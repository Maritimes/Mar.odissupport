==============
Changes
2018.06.15
* realized some tsn searches return likely spelling alternatives when a match is
  found.  Now captures these spellings and tries them against the aphia services
* filtering was majorly reworked, since a huge number of common names were 
  actually scientific
2018.06.11
* major overhaul - should provide better results, but now returns a list of 2 items:
   - results[[1]]: dataframe of species matched to the found codes;
   - results[[2]]: dataframe of species for which multiple, valid records were found.

2018.03.28
* skips searching services for NA values

2018.03.07
* modified ritis check to catch bad results

2018.03.06
* getTaxaIDs() modified to remove reliance of Sci name as a key.

2018.03.01
* getTaxaIDs() first effort is completed.

2018.02.12
* Moved serviceMaker into new "Mar.odisGIS repo", since the dependency on ArcGIS binding prevented general usage

2018.01.19

* Moved getTaxaIDs here from as ITIS is typically of concern to ODIS
* Removed dependencies on taxizesoap, since it depends on SSOAP, which is no longer available
